# NostrPOS
I vibe coded a nostr Point of Sale Terminal using Goose and the PPQ API with the Alex Gleason's [MK Stack](https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/mkstack)

Be aware this is my first vibe coding project.

This may not be ready yet and it has not been audited by a real coder.

The idea is to create a Point of sale system based on the nostr protocol that is lightning address agnostic.

This is the prompt I used.

` Please build me a Nostr client app that is a point of sale terminal similar to BTCpayServer.`
