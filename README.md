# NostrPOS
I vibe coded a nostr Point of Sale Terminal using Goose and the PPQ API with the Alex Gleason's MK Stack https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/mkstack Be aware this is my first vibe coding project. This may not be ready for prime time, but the idea is to create a Point of sale system based on the nostr protocol that is lightning address agnostic.
